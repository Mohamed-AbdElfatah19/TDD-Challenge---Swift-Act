# TDD-Challenge---Swift-Act

Description : 
Developing the "speed control" module such that The Design follows a time triggered approch , Design is implemented using test-driven development approch 


Modules in project :  Switch -> speedControl -> Motor 



Period of tasks( update fn ) : 
switch task is 20 ms 
speedcontrol task is 20 ms 
motor task is 10 ms 



How to test project : 
1.Change value of ( N_INPUT_TEST_CASES ) macro in main.c file , by default = 5 
2.Write state of every switch in switches.txt 
3.Run project 
4.Check on output ( angle of motor )in motor.txt
